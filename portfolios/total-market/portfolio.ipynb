    "## A financial tool that can analyze and maximize investment portfolios on a risk adjusted basis  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Features</u>\n",
    "- Determines the highest performing Investment Options for each Asset Class, based on risk adjusted returns. \n",
    "- Calculates Performance Metrics for User Specified Portfolios\n",
    "- Optimizes a portfolio for risk adjusted returns with an option to specify the minimum annual return rate\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>How to guide</u>\n",
    "- Install anaconda (see https://www.anaconda.com to get Jupter notebook.  Or just install jupyter notebook (see https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "- Create a subfolder under 'universe' for your investment options, aka your investment galaxy.  Within that folder, create the files investment-options.csv and asset-classes.csv.  investment-options.csv contains the investment options available for your investment galaxy, or a subset of the options you wish to consider.  asset-options.csv contains additional asset classes for your galaxy, to extend the standard asset classes defined in standard-asset-classes.csv.  As an example, see securian-401k.\n",
    "- assign the variables investment_universe and risk_free_rate.\n",
    "- specify custom portfolios using your investment options.\n",
    "- assign the variable portfolio_option to point to the portfolio you wish to analyze\n",
    "- run the notebook\n",
    "- optionally, run the optimizer by setting run_portfolio_optimizer to True\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Annual Returns, Risk, and Risk Adjusted Returns</u>\n",
    "- Annual Returns are the equivalent annual return an investor receives over a given period, expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "- Risk refers to the degree of uncertainty and/or potential financial loss inherent in an investment, expressed as annualized Standard Deviation of the returns.\n",
    "- Risk Adjusted Return is a calculation of the profit or potential profit from an investment that takes into account the degree of risk that must be accepted in order to achieve it, expressed as the Sharpe Ratio.  The risk is measured in comparison to that of a virtually risk-free investment. U.S. Treasuries are usually used for comparison.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Diversification</u>  \n",
    "\"By building a portfolio invested in multiple uncorrelated assets an investor can achieve better returns per unit of risk (Sharpe ratio) due to portfolio diversification\".  This is accomplished by choosing investments from different asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Annualized Returns</u>  \n",
    "Use 5 year returns because some of the investment option returns are \"hypothetical\" beyond that, i.e. some of the 10 year mark returns are simulated based on modeling and not real returns.  The funds may not have existed beyond 5 years.  The returns should be already net of expenses, so no need to subtract them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Risk Free Rate</u>  \n",
    "\"Investors commonly use the interest rate on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) as a proxy for the short-term risk-free rate because short-term government-issued securities have virtually zero risks of default, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\"  If you don't have a short-term treasury option available, then use any investment option in your account that has a guaranteed return with zero (very small) risk.  If no such option exists, then set risk_free_rate to zero, i.e. risk_free_rate=0.  For the sample securian-401k.csv, the risk free option is 'Minnesota Life General Account'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Standard Asset Classes</u>  \n",
    "Standard asset class mapping are specified in standard-asset-classes.csv.\n",
    "- US Stocks- aka equities are stocks and mutual funds, represent shares of ownership in publicly held companies\n",
    "- Global Stocks - focus on International Equities\n",
    "- Bonds - aka fixed income investments, generally pay a set rate of interest over a given period, then return the investor's principal.\n",
    "- Cash Equivalents - assets similar to cash in regards to risk and liquidity\n",
    "- Real Estate - home or investment property, plus shares of funds that invest in commercial real estate\n",
    "- Commodities - physical goods such as gold, copper, crude oil, natural gas, wheat, corn, and even electricity.\n",
    "- Currencies - foreign exchange market, e.g. EUR/USD currency pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Optimizer</u>  \n",
    "Optimize sharpe ratio while allowing a min_annual_rate.  Setting min_annual_rate to None optimizes sharpe_ratio without regard to min_annual_rate.  Calculation is done via a Monte Carlo Simulation by trying random\n",
    "combinations of weights and checking which combination has the best sharpe_ratio.  As a result, results may vary slightly between optimizations even when using the same inputs. \n",
